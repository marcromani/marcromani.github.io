My name is **Marc Roman√≠**. I'm a computer science enthusiast and I like to write about things that I find interesting in this field. I mostly care about machine learning, signal processing and optimization. I talk code too.

One of the reasons I write is the fact that it forces me to revisit concepts and solidify ideas. I also tend to forget more than I'd want to, so this place serves me as a drawer of things that I once learned and to which I can come back if I ever need to.

If you enjoy any of it let me know!
